# Simple Scala Play 2.5.4 application

Motivation for this project was to create simplest Play 2.5.4 application without Guice injection. I think Scala doesn't need any additional implisit dependency injections and compile-time dependency makes development and mocking in autotests and way more simple and predictable.

It contains few example implementations:
* actor that contains counter of all views as its state and gives it to controller that responds to REST HTTP request
* some settings
* manifests info and `environment` variable
